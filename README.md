# Have I Been PWNED clone application

## Requirements

Using the HiBP API : https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2 , create a front end having the following functionalities:

- search for breaches and display them (with pagination and total number)
- search by account or email and display if your account was compromised in any breach. List them in the same way like in the previous view
- add a detailed view for the breach where you display the following data:
  + description
  + breach date
  + image
  + compromised data
  + compromised accounts
  + date added to HiBP
- the detailed view must contain a breadcrumb which, by clicking on the parent (Breaches or Accounts), it must redirect you to the search page where it must have the same state as before clicking.
- it should be a Single Page Application, so don't change the html file and don't add any ;)
- don't use any external library or package

## Use postman to test the API:

## Basic mocks - you can add any design you want, the mocks are made just to describe the functionality
